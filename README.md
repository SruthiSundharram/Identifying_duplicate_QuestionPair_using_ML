# Identifying_duplicate_QuestionPair_using_ML
- Implemented end-to-end machine learning model to predict if given two questions have the same semantic meaning.
- Used Quora question pair similarity dataset and embeddings from pretrained model for detecting semantic similarity. 
- The ain goal of this project is to reduce the amount of duplicate entries that are often present inForums and QnA sections of many eLearning Platforms.
-  This project was aimed at finding those duplicate questions using the recent advances in natural language processing domain like embeddings from pretrained models
