# Identifying_duplicate_QuestionPair_using_ML
- Implemented end-to-end machine learning model to predict if given two questions have the same semantic meaning.
- Used Quora question pair similarity dataset and embeddings from the pre-trained model for detecting semantic similarity. 
- The main goal of this project is to reduce the amount of duplicate entries that are often present in the Forum and QnA sections of many eLearning Platforms.
-  This project was aimed at finding those duplicate questions using the recent advances in the natural language processing domain like embeddings from pre-trained models
